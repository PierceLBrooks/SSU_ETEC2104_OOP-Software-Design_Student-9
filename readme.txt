In order to fulfill the requirements of this assignment...
you must only make changes to the "You.hpp" file and the "CMakeLists.txt" file.

Be sure that when someone clones your code onto their system, they are able to produce a MinGW Makefile with CMake and build it with the "mingw32-make" command
(and also that the program compiles and runs as expected).

When you are finished with your work, remember to commit and push to the repository.
Speak with me during class to demonstrate what you have done, and you will receive full credit.

Good luck!
